# Multiple Linear Regression

**Project Overview**

For this project, I created a linear regression model from scratch, while refraining from using any third party libraries which already contain these functions, such as sklearn. I then used the model to explore the linear relationship between property features and sales values for houses sold in King County, WA between May 2014 and May 2015.
